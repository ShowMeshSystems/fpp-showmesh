# something that would otherwise be discovered on a real Pi, the hard way.

# Requires python3 to synthesize small ELF and tarball fixtures; that is a
# dev/CI-machine requirement only, and is never a runtime dependency of the
# scripts under test, which stay plain POSIX sh with no Python involved.

# Run with: sh test/run_tests.sh  (or bash, or dash — POSIX only, no bashisms)
